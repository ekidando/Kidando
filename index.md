Currently, I'm  a Doctoral Candidate in Civil Engineering at Florida (FSU) working on Implemenation of Connected Vehicle Infrastructure Systems and Data Analytics in Transportation Research working under <a href="http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~moses/">Dr. Ren Moses</a>. As a statistical data scientist, I am interested in parametric and nonparametric models, machine learning methods, deep learning frameworks, cloud computing, statistical modeling techniques and design of experiments.

I have a practical experience on Bayesian data analytics and Machine learning application where I worked on Intelligent Transportation Systems design architecture, vehicle to infrastructure communication devices and the operations of dedicated short-range communications. I have employed my Data Science expertise to predict conditions on roadway using machine learning (ensemble methods), deep learning frameworks and statistical models for connected and autonomous vehicle case studies.

I enjoy working on interdisciplinary research in engineering, statistics and computational sciences.
