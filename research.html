         <p>This project is about evaluating the efficacy of DSRC in improving efficiency and safety of road users along a signalized-intersections corridor. The project involves assessing pre-ATSPM/CV operational and safety, testing and deployment of CV technologies on Mahan corridor, and conducting after-study to evaluate the operational and safety benefits of CV applications.</p>

                  This project was part of UTC research that developed a network level capacity model for reliability analysis. The study particulary focused on elderly adult population. In the modeling process, traffic data and aging driving patterns were intergrated in the model. The developed model is anticipated to provide agencies with efficient transportation management and operations procedures.

          The tasks of this project involved collecting data on the distribution of axle spacing of bobtails and the distribution of axle weights of the front axle and the tandem axles. Statistical data analysis was explored to identify the dimensions thresholds/ranges, including percentiles, median, and standard deviation. These parameters were very important in the accuracy sensors.

          In addition, the impact of temperature variable was assessed on the accuracy of weigh-in-motion sensors in measuring the weight of trucks. Different statistical models were explored in the analysis.

                <p>State agencies such as Tennessee Governor’s Highway Safety Office (GHSO) work with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to implement traffic safety enforcement programs focusing on occupant protection, impaired driving, speed enforcement, truck and school bus safety, pedestrian and bicycle safety. The objectives of this research were to develop the traffic enforcement ranking and funding criteria as well as a tool that take into account several variables in allocating annual grant for traffic enforcement. The variables that were considered include county crashes (Equivalent Property Damage Only, injury severities, alcohol related, speeding related and motorcycle related), population, vehicle miles of travel (VMT), and the crashes involving young and senior drivers. The developed tool was based on Microsoft ACCESS database with the capability of generating reports in PDF or Excel files <p/>

            <p>This study used the handheld LTL-X Retroreflectometer to measure pavement marking retroreflectivity levels on selected highway for a period of two years and then the collected data were used to develop a correlation between time and retroreflectivity levels. Regression models were developed for predicting the time pavement markings stay within the acceptable limits based on the geographic locations, pavement marking material type, and traffic volume. <p/>

      <h2>Bicycle and Pedestrians Route Planning in Pleasant View town, TN</h2>
      </div></div>

        <div class="block">

  
             <p>
           This paper evaluated small city bicycle route planning using both Bicycle Level of Service (BLOS) and Latent Demand Score (LDS) models. Using the city of Pleasant View, TN as the case study, it was found that the two methodologies are relevant for small city planning but with some limitations. The BLOS model was challenged with the availability of daily traffic volume data, which is scarce for non-state roadways in a small city. BLOS scores were grade C or better meaning that those roadways are suitable for bicycle travel. The challenge for the LDS model was the availability of trip purpose data within the city, so nationwide values based on urban areas, were used. Another limitation of LDS, whose results are given as the relative demand, was choosing the most appropriate bike facility considering the magnitude of the demand when compared to that of a metropolitan area. The bike facilities chosen to be most appropriate for the bicycle network design are bike lane, paved shoulder, and shared roadway.

            This project involved collecting data by recording videos and extraction of the important parameters for safety and operation characteristics analysis. Data were collected and signal warrant procedures recommendend in the MUTCD were used to evaluate the need for upgrading an intersection by installing a traffic signal.
